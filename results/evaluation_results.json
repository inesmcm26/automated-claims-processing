On that same day, I underwent emergency eye surgery (pterygium excision) at Centro M\u00e9dico Integral NOVAMEDIC, which rendered me unfit to travel and required a 15-day rest period.\n\nThe procedure was unplanned and medically necessary. I have attached the medical certificate, confirming the surgery and the rest period from 29 July to 12 August 2023.\n\nAs a result, I was unable to take my flight to Quito that afternoon. \n\nSince i was unable to take the flight, so please compensate me the full ticket price of 129 euros.\n\nThank you in advance",
